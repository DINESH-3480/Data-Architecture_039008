# Wildfire Analysis and Impact Assessment

This repository contains the report **"Wildfire Analysis and Impact Assessment"** by Dinesh Murugan. The analysis leverages an open-source dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to explore trends in wildfire incidents, quantify their impacts, and provide data-driven recommendations for improved wildfire management and public safety.

## Open-Source Data Information

The analysis is based on an open-source dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset was chosen for its comprehensive coverage of wildfire incidents and includes details such as:

- **Incident Duration:** Start and extinguished times.
- **Human Impact:** Data on injuries and fatalities.
- **Property Damage:** Records of affected structures.

This rich dataset enables a robust understanding of wildfire behavior and supports detailed impact analysis.

---

## Purpose and Goals

The primary objectives of this study are to:

- **Analyze Wildfire Incidents:** Identify trends in wildfire duration, frequency, and intensity.
- **Assess Impacts:** Quantify effects on human lives, property, and the environment.
- **Inform Policy and Preparedness:** Generate actionable insights to enhance emergency response, update building codes, and improve evacuation strategies.

These goals help support stakeholders in making informed decisions to mitigate future wildfire risks.

## Key Questions on the Data

The analysis addresses several critical questions, including:

1. **What is the average duration of wildfires?**  
   *Understanding typical fire duration aids in resource allocation and response planning.*

2. **How much property has been affected by wildfires?**  
   *Quantifying property damage is vital for economic impact assessments and insurance planning.*

3. **How many human lives have been impacted by wildfires?**  
   *Assessing casualty figures is crucial for evaluating public safety and emergency readiness.*

Additional questions include:
- How have wildfire incidents evolved over the years?
- Which year recorded the highest number of human casualties?
- Which counties experience the most severe wildfire incidents?

---

## Metrics and KPIs

The study defines the following key metrics and KPIs to track operational and strategic objectives:

- **Average Fire Duration:** Approximately 85â€“90 days  
  *Indicates prolonged incidents requiring sustained firefighting efforts.*

- **Year-over-Year Change in Fire Duration:** Approximately -0.60 days  
  *Suggests slight improvements or seasonal variations in wildfire behavior.*

- **Total Property Damage:** 68K structures affected  
  *Highlights significant economic losses and the need for resilient infrastructure.*

- **Total Human Impact:** 1,755 casualties (injuries and fatalities)  
  *Emphasizes the severe human toll and the importance of effective evacuation strategies.*

## Data Model

The data model used in the analysis consists of several layers:

- **Data Ingestion and Cleaning:**  
  Raw data from Kaggle is cleaned and transformed; outliers and inconsistencies are addressed.

- **Computation of Derived Metrics:**  
  Fire durations are calculated from start and extinguished times, and YoY comparisons are performed.

- **Relational Structure:**  
  The dataset is organized to link wildfire incidents with corresponding human and property impact metrics, supporting time-series trend analysis.

- **Visualization Integration:**  
  Power BI dashboards are used to illustrate key insights such as average durations and regional impact variations.

---

## Results

The analysis yielded several key findings:

- **Wildfire Duration:**  
  Fires typically last between 85 and 90 days, indicating prolonged events.

- **Regional Impact:**  
  High-impact areas are predominantly on the West Coast (e.g., California, Nevada, Oregon), with counties like Riverside, San Diego, and San Luis Obispo being most affected.

- **Temporal Trends:**  
  There is a notable peak in wildfire incidents around 2017, with that year recording the highest casualties.

- **Effectiveness of Firefighting Efforts:**  
  Despite effective firefighting efforts, the sheer scale of incidents presents ongoing challenges.

---

## Conclusions

The report concludes that:

- **Wildfires have significant impacts** on the environment, human lives, and infrastructure.
- **Actionable recommendations** include enhancing evacuation protocols, reinforcing building codes, and investing in preventative measures.
- **Data-driven decision-making** using robust metrics and a comprehensive data model is crucial for future improvements in wildfire management and public safety.
